1. What is React, and why is it used for building user interfaces?
React is a javascript library it is used to build user interfaces
we use react because it helps to build the single page applicatios using its feature like
virtual DOM, hooks, reusable components it makes the web app more faster and efficiently

2. Explain the concept of the Virtual DOM and how it improves performance.

Virtual DOM is like a light-weight copy of the real DOM 
Whenever something changes like props or state updating entire dom is not efficeient for performence and
frequent changes so react uses concept of virtual DOM
so react first updates the virtual dom instead of changing the old dom directly
Then it compares old and new virtual DOM and updates only the necasary changes
this process is called as reconcilation 
this concepot makes chnages faster and application efficient

3. What are the main differences between class components and functional
components?
Class components are the ES6 classes that extends React.Component and uses render methodsto
return an react element

functional components are normal javascript functions that returns a react element
 they accept props and can use state
Functional components have overcome the class componenets

4. What is JSX, and why is it preferred over plain JavaScript?
JSX stand for ther JavaScript XML (extensive markup language)
JSX allows us to write html code directly into js
It looks like html but it is written in js

5. Explain the concept of “one-way data flow” in React.
One-way data flow means data moves only in one direction
ex from parent compoent to child component
it is like props so the child compoentn cannot directly change the data it is read only
one way flow maks application easy to manage

6. What are props in React, and how do they differ from state?
Props is the way to pass data from one compoennt to another component
ex we can pass data from parent component to child component 
this props data is read only so it can not be modify
passing props in larger application to every level can be messy

7. What is state management, and why is it important in React applications?
state management is the process of how we control and update data that changes in our app
it is important because when state changes our ui should also get update
when state data get changed ouur ui also get re rendered

8. What are React Hooks, and why were they introduced?
hooks are special functions in react it includes useState, useEffect, etc
it allow us to use state and other react features in functional components directly 
they introdueced because
they aloows us to use states
make ciode simple and easy to read
overcome the use of class components

9. Explain the purpose of the useState hook.
useState is the built in hook in react ehich is use to store and upadate the state in functional components
useState helpsn us to update the ui based on the state chnages
useState contains a state varible and a function to update that state

10. Explain the purpose of the useEffect hook and when it is used.
useState is the built in hook in react ehich is use to handle the side effects 
side effect can be any chnages outaside of the functional component
useeffect is used to run side effects like calling api, fetchig data, timers,etc
it has 4 types of depedencies
no depedency
empty depedency
single
multiple depedency

11. What are controlled and uncontrolled components in React?
controlled components is where form input values are controlled by react itself using the state
best when we needed to track and validate the input data

uncontrolled components where input value are not handled by the react the input itself handled the state
in this we use useRef to access those values best fot the simple forms

12. What is React Context, and when should you use it?
context is the feature in ract using which we can pass the data to every component without doing
props drilling it avoids passing data to each component unnecessarily
in this we pass every data to root compoennt so every child component can access that data easily
as prop drilling can be messy for larger application so we avoid it usiong Context

13. Explain what lifting state up means in React and why it is important


14. What is component re-rendering, and what causes it in React?
component re rendering is react re render the entire functional compoent when any data chnages
rerendering causes when
state changes
props change
forced rendered
parent get render
we can avoid unnecessary re-renddering using memoization methods which can imporve perrformnace optimization

15. What is React’s reconciliation process?
Whenever something changes like props or state updating entire dom is not efficeient for performence and
frequent changes so react uses concept of virtual DOM
so react first updates the virtual dom instead of changing the old dom directly
Then it compares old and new virtual DOM and updates only the necasary changes
this process is called as reconcilation it makes chnages faster and efficient
it helps chnaging entire dom it only perform necasary chnages

16. What are higher-order components (HOCs) in React?
higher-order components are like higher-order functions
it can take a component as a argument or input and can also returns a new component

17. Explain the purpose of React Fragments.
fragement is used to grup the react elemets together 
it helps us to avoid using extra html tag
ex like we use <div></div> to group the elements so instead that we can use <></> tag
it keep structure simple and minimal


18. What is the significance of the key prop in lists?
when we map the array or list we use key props for each element
as it is important because it helps react know which element is updated or removed fromt the list or array
so it is necasary to use key prop for optimization

19. What is prop drilling, and how can it be avoided?
prop drilling means passing props data through multiple layers of components
for ex if the sub chikld compoennt needed the prop data so we have to pass it from parent to child and then to subcjild
this becomes messy in larger application as we pass unnecessary data to every level
we an avoid it by using context or redux

20. What is memoization in React, and why is it important?
memoization is a optimization texhnique in react it helps to avoid unnecessary things to not happen
like unnecessary re rendering, recalculation or function recreation
it includes 
React.memo()
useMemo
useCallback

21. Explain what React Router is and why it is used.
React Router is a library that enables the navigation in react application it enables navigation 
from one page to another without reloading the entire page
it includes concepts like
BrowserRouter
Routes
Route
useParams
Link
using redux for large application is best

22. What is server-side rendering (SSR) in React, and what benefits does it provide?

23. Explain the concept of lazy loading in React.
lazy loading is the optimization technique in react 
in which it avoid loadinf the resources or compoennts untill they are actually needed
thi makes application more optimized and faster

24. What is Redux, and why is it used alongside React?
Redux is the feature in react it is like a big store or centralised store wher all the important data get store
so that other functional components can easily access and modify it 
it avoid unnecessary prop drilling and store the data in a centralised store from which all the compoenntm access
that data easily 
it includes
store
actrion
useReducer
Dispatch

25. What are React performance optimization techniques you can apply in large application
1. lazy loading is the optimization technique in react 
in which it avoid loadinf the resources or compoennts untill they are actually needed
thi makes application more optimized and faster

2.memoization is a optimization texhnique in react it helps to avoid unnecessary things to not happen
like unnecessary re rendering, recalculation or function recreation
it includes 
React.memo()
useMemo
useCallback

3.Compressed images we can use comparesed images and can also implment
lazy loading for them

4.rendering large list we can avoid rendering entire list as fetching only list which needs to be display
